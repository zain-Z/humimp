-added vission.html and contact.html to templates,  this done
-there are some things i couldn't make a decision with:-(because i know you will change it or delete it later):-(no problem reaaallly)
  1- (actually, i forgot this page and i decide to make this page like stories and careers) in what_we_are_doing_details.html ( line 108 images/  , line 107 data-src= images/ ) you have to change them to smth like {{i.your_var_name}}

  3- index.html ( line 129 ) you have slide pictures so i don't know what to do with it , ( done )
  4- teams.html ( done )
  5- stories.html ( not )
  6- stories_detail.html ( not )
-didn't do anything for contact.html done but have problem in form in html i just need to show filed(fullname, email, phone number, subject and message)
-don't forget what i had said about applicantslist.html (actually i forget what you saied)
***** maybe there are more things that i didn't notice ****** yeap me too but i changed things and also forgot to share with you 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

warnings:
-didn't make views for vision(i did it )
-in each template we have to figure out a color for the background and don't forget to set width to 1920 and height to 320(tomorrow i will do it)
-if you are goint to call an image like this {{var_name_image}} .. you have to add ".url" so it will be like this {{var_name_image.url}} (it worked with me when i add image inside for loop i didn't face these problem)
-if you are goint to call an image like this {{i.var_name_image}} .. don't write url in the end (notic some image work well without adding .url other not like slider image didnot show image until i add .url, so i do not have problem with other image)
-in all your templates .. add t to about because it's like that "abou" in the footer(i did it)
-index.html (line 58 , 172 ) actually, i didnot know what the problem in these line.......
