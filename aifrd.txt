jobs app:

1) what i did :
- changed all the templates like yours and fixed paths and urls
- changed models ( added your new models to the old models ) 
- changed serializers
- changed admin list display

2) notice :
-added vission.html and contact.html to templates
-didn't take care of any imports ( it's up to you )
-didn't run the code or see if it it does work or not because i don't want to fix anything ( waiting for you until you finish what all you had started so i can work clean without deleting my work and do efforts in garbage and then i found that you wanted me to do something else )
-there are some things i couldn't make a decision with:-(because i know you will change it or delete it later):-
  1- in what_we_are_doing_details.html ( line 108 images/  , line 107 data-src= images/ ) you have to change them to smth like {{i.your_var_name}}
  2- vision-mission-value.html ( line 7 ) 
  3- index.html ( line 129 ) you have slide pictures so i don't know what to do with it , ( line 216 )
  4- teams.html ( line 7 )
  5- stories.html ( line 7 )
  6- stories_detail.html ( line 7 )
-didn't do anything for contact.html
-don't forget what i had said about applicantslist.html
***** maybe there are more things that i didn't notice ******

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

warnings:
-didn't make views for vision
-in each template we have to figure out a color for the background and don't forget to set width to 1920 and height to 320
-if you are goint to call an image like this {{var_name_image}} .. you have to add ".url" so it will be like this {{var_name_image.url}}
-if you are goint to call an image like this {{i.var_name_image}} .. don't write url in the end
-in all your templates .. add t to about because it's like that "abou" in the footer
